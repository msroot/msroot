# Hi there 👋 I'm Yannis 


###  Software Engineer | Designing & Building Secure, Scalable Systems & APIs

I’ve spent the last 20 years turning complex business puzzles into clean, high-performance software. 

I’m a big believer in the **Unix philosophy**: keep it simple, make it efficient, and ensure it works beautifully with others.

### 🚀 What I’m working with:
* **Core Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js, Redis, AWS, ZeroMQ
* **API Design:** GraphQL (Apollo Server), REST.
* **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, CircleCI, Serverless.
* **Database Design:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch
* **AI/Data:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Neo4j (Knowledge Graphs), Qdrant.
* **Legacy Expertise:** Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RubyGrape, RSpec

### 🧠 Featured AI Project: [docuGraphRAG.js](https://github.com/msroot/docuGraphRAG.js)

A specialized library for transforming unstructured text into **Knowledge Graphs** for enhanced AI retrieval (RAG).

* **Architecture:** Combines **Neo4j** for relationship mapping and **Qdrant** for vector embeddings.
* **Value:** Solves the context-limitation of standard vector search by providing LLMs with structured entity-relation data.
* **Stack:** Node.js, Neo4j, Qdrant, Docker, OpenAI API.

### 🛠️ Open Source & Impact

* **Contributor:** Stripe, GraphQLAutotest, Stackreduce.
* **Creator:** * `Garfield`: A GraphQL Policy engine for secure schema access.
    * `jsonLogic-GraphQL-Query`: Logic-based querying for flexible GraphQL APIs.
    * `RunLater`, `Reportly`, `CheckoutTo`, `Notify.js`.

### 🌱 Beyond the Code

When I’m not architecting systems, you’ll probably find me:
* 🥾 **Hiking** mountain trails and exploring hidden landscapes.
* 🍳 **Cooking** and experimenting with fermentation in my kitchen.
* 🎧 **Mixing music** or diving into a good book.
* 🧘 Practicing a bit of yoga to stay balanced.
